# The Battle of Neighborhoods
### The Battle of Neighborhoods is my [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) Capstone Project, using FourSqaure API.

The Scenario of the project is that a developers who lives in west side of torronto canada and has been offered a great opportunity but on the other side of the city, hence the developer needs to find a neighborhood which is almost same as its current neighborhood. Now to find a neighborhood which is as similar to the current neighborhood of the developer we will collect data from the Four Squares API to obtain Location Data for the neighborhoods of the city of torronto.

Location data is data describing places and venues, such as their geographical location, their category, working hours, full address, and so on, such that for a given location you will be able to tell if restaurants for example, exist nearby, or if schools, or parks, or gyms, or community centres exist nearby. Also, how many of each category exist and how each surrounding venue is reviewed by other people.

This Project will be built using Machine Learning and Data Analysis using Python and SCIKIT-Learn.
